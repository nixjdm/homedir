# Homedir

Inspired by https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/homedir, I'll fill this out as time goes on.

I also have [my own repo for my ~/.emacs.d dir](https://github.com/nixjdm/emacs.d)

## Setup

```shell
cd
git clone https://github.com/nixjdm/homedir.git
mv homedir/.[Xa-z]* homedir/* .
rmdir homedir
```
